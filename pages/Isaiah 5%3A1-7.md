	- 1 Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:
	- 2 and he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof,
	  and planted it with the choicest vine,
	  and built a tower in the midst of it,
	  and also made a winepress therein:
	  and he looked that it should bring forth grapes,
	  and it brought forth wild grapes.
	- 3 And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah,
	  judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.
	- 4 What could have been done more to my vineyard,
	  that I have not done in it?
	  wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes,
	  brought it forth wild grapes?
	- 5 And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard:
	  I will take away the hedge thereof,
	  and it shall be eaten up;
	  *and* break down the wall thereof,
	  and it shall be trodden down:
	- 6 and I will lay it waste:
	  it shall not be pruned, nor digged;
	  but there shall come up briers and thorns:
	  I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
	- 7 For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts *is* the house of Israel,
	  and the men of Judah his pleasant plant:
	  and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression;
	  for righteousness, but behold a cry.
