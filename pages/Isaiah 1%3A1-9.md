	- 1 The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, *and* Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
	- 2 Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth:
	  for the Lord hath spoken,
	  I have nourished and brought up children,
	  and they have rebelled against me.
	- 3 The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib:
	  *but* Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.
	- 4 Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity,
	  a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters:
	  they have forsaken the Lord,
	  they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger,
	  they are gone away backward.
	- 5 Why should ye be stricken any more?
	  ye will revolt more and more:
	  the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
	- 6 From the sole of the foot even unto the head
	  *there is* no soundness in it;
	  *but* wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores:
	  they have not been closed,
	  neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.
	- 7 Your country *is* desolate, your cities *are* burned with fire:
	  your land, strangers devour it in your presence,
	  and *it is* desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
	- 8 And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard,
	  as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers,
	  as a besieged city.
	- 9 Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant,
	  we should have been as Sodom,
	  *and* we should have been like unto Gomorrah.
