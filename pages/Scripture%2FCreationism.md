		- There has never been an observation of a gene gaining information, it is not science to assume something that has never been observed and has nothing to even imply that it could happen. Loss of genetic information is provable, observable and recorded. Furthermore, it's effects are to a large degree predictable. The issue is that evolution assumes 0 genetic information in the beginning to the vast wealth of information today, Creationism states that Adam and Eve had all the genetic information from the beginning and a lot of things happened between then and now but we now have less. Science belongs to Creationism.
		- Why would every new adaptation cause all others of the species to become extinct?
			- In evolution, the theory would require that a new adaptation to permeate throughout the species and all others die for some weird reason.
			- In Creation the genetics for all adaptations are already there and the adaptations become more prevalent naturally as any species is looking for the healthier mate.

	- It is a fallacy to believe that facts speak for themselves... They are always interpreted according to a framework. The framework behind the evolutionists' interpretation is "naturalism", it is assumed that things made themselves, that no divine intervention has happened and that God has not revealed to us knowledge of the past.
