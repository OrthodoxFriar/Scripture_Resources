	- 29 And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
	- 30 But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.
	- 31 And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.
	- 32 And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.
	- 33 And all the city was gathered together at the door.
	- 34 And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.
	- 35 And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.
	- 36 And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.
	- 37 And when they had found him, they said unto him, All *men* seek for thee.
	- 38 And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.
	- 39 And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.
