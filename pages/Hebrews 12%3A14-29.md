  Scripture Version:: #AKJV
	- 14 Follow peace with all *men,* and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:
	- 15 looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble *you,* and thereby many be defiled;
	- 16 lest there *be* any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.
	- 17 For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.
	- 18 For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,
	- 19 and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which *voice* they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:
	- 20 (for they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:
	- 21 and so terrible was the sight, *that* Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)
	- 22 but ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,
	- 23 to the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,
	- 24 and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than *that of* Abel.
	- 25 See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more *shall not* we *escape,* if we turn away from him that *speaketh* from heaven:
	- 26 whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.
	- 27 And this *word,* Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
	- 28 Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:
	- 29 for our God *is* a consuming fire.
