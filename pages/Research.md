	- ### About
		- #### Research is constrained to modern life as a Friar with a focus on spiritual warfare.
			- Backlinks create pages, this is perfect. Any legitimate research gets it's own page but I will use page creation sparingly. Master backlinks and queries.
				- ### Queries filter information
				- Client page is backlinks  or queries
				- Project page is backlinks or queries
			- Everything that is important must be saved locally and Logseq and Zotero is the place to save it. Only these 2 local programs are necessary and safe.
			- I'm trying to figure out the topics that I want to research so that I can limit my efforts to just those subjects.
			- I think that the best place to start is with my kindle library I need to look at the whole library not just [[Spiritual Warfare]].
			- If something is important, copy it and save it to Logseq - Zotero.
