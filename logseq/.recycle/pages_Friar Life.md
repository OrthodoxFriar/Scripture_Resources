		- Why
			- Because a written Rule of Life gives you a baseline to measure against and as it changes over time it keeps you reaching further. It is the main way that a Friar achieves his goals.
		- How
			- A Rule of Life is a living document always challenging you to do better and to work harder.
		- What
			- The Scripture has not changed in nearly 2000 years because God does not change but people do. The RoL is a living changing document that grows with you always presenting a challenge and a baseline for when you fall.
	- What: You actually have no choice but to start with what but the What that you begin with will change as you learn about Why
		- Why is so important because it is your motivation and it needs to be consistent with your What or you have the wrong What
		- How is mostly taken care of by your brain but writing things down will help you to understand the situation.
		- Conflicts are things that achieving your What would cause you to lose something else. A lot of people have trouble because their What conflicts with some other area of their life.
