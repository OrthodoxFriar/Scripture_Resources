	- 21 How is the faithful city become an harlot!
	  it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it;
	  but now murderers.
	- 22 Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:
	- 23 thy princes *are* rebellious, and companions of thieves:
	  every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards:
	  they judge not the fatherless,
	  neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.
	- 24 Therefore saith the Lord,
	  the Lord of hosts, the mighty One of Israel,
	  Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:
	- 25 and I will turn my hand upon thee,
	  and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:
	- 26 and I will restore thy judges as at the first,
	  and thy counsellors as at the beginning:
	  afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.
	- 27 Zion shall be redeemed with judgment,
	  and her converts with righteousness.
	- 28 And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners *shall be* together,
	  and they that forsake the Lord shall be consumed.
