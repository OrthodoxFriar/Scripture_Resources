# Scripture_Resources
## Work in progress

This is a project using the program https://logseq.com/ all the editable files are markdown.

I am currently adding all of the Scripture from the "Authorized King James Version" of the Bible this will include the Apocrypha. I am doing this while reading the bible in a year chronologically. I plan on adding other versions depending on their copyright status, probably the NIV and the ESV. 

I will also be adding the readings for Morning and Evening Prayer from the **1928 Book of Common Prayer** but for now my priority is getting all of the Scripture into Logseq.

The sources are mainly from the Internet Archive https://archive.org/ with some use of https://www.biblegateway.com/ the formating of the Psalms is much better on Bible Gateway. I am converting everything by hand right now which is labor intensive and can be prone to errors, I will likely start automating things as I go. Even with automation going chapter by chapter will take time.
