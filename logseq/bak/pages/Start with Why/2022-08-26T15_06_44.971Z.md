	- What: You actually have no choice but to start with what but the What that you begin with will change as you learn about Why
		- Why is so important because it is your motivation and it needs to be consistent with your What or you have the wrong What
		- How is mostly taken care of by your brain but writing things down will help you to understand the situation.
		- Conflicts are things that achieving your What would cause you to lose something else. A lot of people have trouble because their What conflicts with some other area of their life.
