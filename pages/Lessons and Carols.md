		  and said unto him, Where art thou?
		- 10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid,
		- because I was naked; and I hid myself.
		- 11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, 
		  whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
		- 12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me,
		  she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
		- 13 And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? 
		  And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
		- 14 And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, 
		  thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field;
		  upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
		- 15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed
		  and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
		- 16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
		  conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire
		  shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
		- 17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy
		  wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying,
		  Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in
		  sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
		- 18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat
		  the herb of the field;
		- 19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the
		  ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto
		  dust shalt thou return.

		  mind what manner of salutation this should be.
		- **30 **And
		  the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour
		  with God.
		- **31 **And,
		  behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and
		  shalt call his name Jesus.
		- **32 **He
		  shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the
		  Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:
		- **33 **And
		  he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom
		  there shall be no end.
		- **34 **Then
		  said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?
		- **35 **And
		  the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon
		  thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore
		  also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the
		  Son of God.
		- **36 **And,
		  behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her
		  old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.
		- **37 **For

		  Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a
		  public example, was minded to put her away privily.

		  while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of
		  the Lord appeared
		  unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to
		  take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is
		  of the Holy Ghost.
		- **21 **And
		  she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus:
		  for he shall save his people from their sins.
		- **22 **Now

		  Lord by the prophet, saying,
		- **23 **Behold,
		  a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they

		  suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host
		  praising God, and saying,
		- **14 **Glory
		  to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.
		- **15 **And
		  it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven,
		  the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem,
		  and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made
		  known unto us.
		- **16 **And

		  Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them
		  diligently what time the star appeared.
		- **8 **And

		  young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I
		  may come and worship him also.
		- **9 **When
		  they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they
