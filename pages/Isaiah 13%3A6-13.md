  Scripture Version:: #AKJV
	- 6 Howl ye; for the day of the Lord *is* at hand;
	  it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.
	- 7 Therefore shall all hands be faint,
	  and every man’s heart shall melt:
	- 8 and they shall be afraid:
	  pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them;
	  they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth:
	  they shall be amazed one at another;
	  their faces *shall be as* flames.
	- 9 Behold, the day of the Lord cometh,
	  cruel both with wrath and fierce anger,
	  to lay the land desolate:
	  and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.
	- 10 For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light:
	  the sun shall be darkened in his going forth,
	  and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.
	- 11 And I will punish the world for *their* evil,
	  and the wicked for their iniquity;
	  and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease,
	  and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.
	- 12 I will make a man more precious than fine gold;
	  even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.
	- 13 Therefore I will shake the heavens,
	  and the earth shall remove out of her place,
	  in the wrath of the Lord of hosts,
	  and in the day of his fierce anger.
