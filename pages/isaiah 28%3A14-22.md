  Scripture Version:: #akjv
	- 14 Wherefore hear the word of the Lord,
	  ye scornful men, that rule this people which *is* in Jerusalem.
	- 15 Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death,
	  and with hell are we at agreement;
	  when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us:
	  for we have made lies our refuge,
	  and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:
	- 16 therefore thus saith the Lord God,
	  Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone,
	  a precious corner *stone*, a sure foundation:
	  he that believeth shall not make haste.
	- 17 Judgment also will I lay to the line,
	  and righteousness to the plummet:
	  and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies,
	  and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.
	- 18 And your covenant with death shall be disannulled,
	  and your agreement with hell shall not stand;
	  when the overflowing scourge shall pass through,
	  then ye shall be trodden down by it.
	- 19 From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you:
	  for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night:
	  and it shall be a vexation only *to* understand the report.
	- 20 For the bed is shorter than that *a man* can stretch himself *on it:*
	  and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself *in it*.
	- 21 For the Lord shall rise up as *in* mount Perazim,
	  he shall be wroth as *in* the valley of Gibeon,
	  that he may do his work, his strange work;
	  and bring to pass his act, his strange act.
	- 22 Now therefore be ye not mockers,
	  lest your bands be made strong:
	  for I have heard from the Lord God of hosts
	  a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.
