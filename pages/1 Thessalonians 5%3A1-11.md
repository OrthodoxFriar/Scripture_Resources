	- 1 But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.
	- 2 For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.
	- 3 For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.
	- 4 But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.
	- 5 Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.
	- 6 Therefore let us not sleep, as *do* others; but let us watch and be sober.
	- 7 For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.
	- 8 But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.
	- 9 For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,
	- 10 who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.
	- 11 Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.
