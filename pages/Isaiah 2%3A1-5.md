	- 1 The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
	- 2 And it shall come to pass in the last days,
	  *that* the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established
	  in the top of the mountains,
	  and shall be exalted above the hills;
	  and all nations shall flow unto it.
	- 3 And many people shall go and say,
	  Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord,
	  to the house of the God of Jacob;
	  and he will teach us of his ways,
	  and we will walk in his paths:
	  for out of Zion shall go forth the law,
	  and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
	- 4 And he shall judge among the nations,
	  and shall rebuke many people:
	  and they shall beat their swords into plowshares,
	  and their spears into pruninghooks:
	  nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
	  neither shall they learn war any more.
	- 5 O house of Jacob, come ye,
	  and let us walk in the light of the Lord.
