	- 10 Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom;
	  give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.
	- 11 To what purpose *is* the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the Lord:
	  I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts;
	  and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.
	- 12 When ye come to appear before me,
	  who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?
	- 13 Bring no more vain oblations;
	  incense is an abomination unto me;
	  the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with;
	  *it is* iniquity, even the solemn meeting.
	- 14 Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth:
	  they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear *them*.
	- 15 And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you:
	  yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear:
	  your hands are full of blood.
	- 16 Wash you, make you clean;
	  put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes;
	  cease to do evil;
	- 17 learn to do well;
	  seek judgment, relieve the oppressed,
	  judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.
	- 18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord:
	  though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow;
	  though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
	- 19 If ye be willing and obedient,
	  ye shall eat the good of the land:
	- 20 but if ye refuse and rebel,
	  ye shall be devoured with the sword:
	  for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken *it*.
